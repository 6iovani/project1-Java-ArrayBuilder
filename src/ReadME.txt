Refactor/Javadocs/README/Input Error Checking

Project Description:
    This project prompts the user for and builds an array of integers.
    The length of the array and the values stored inside are based on user input.
    The code is programmed to display the values before finished running.
    The purpose of this project is to implement error checking, so that the program can run without crashes.

User Guide:
    Enter a positive number at the prompt to get set the array length.
    Enter a positive number(s) at the following prompt to store values into the array.
    (The number of prompts after the first varies based on user input in the first prompt.)

Error:
    If the user enters a positive int greater than the Java int value limit of 2,147,483,647,
    the program will crash. Besides this, everything should work as expected.
